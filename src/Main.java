    /** 1. Write a method called numberOfVowels()
           Given a string, **numberOfVowels** will return the number of vowels in that string. 
           Consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels.
     **/
    

    /** 2. Write a method called notDivisibleBy235()
           Given a number N, **notDivisibleBy235** will return the number of natural numbers 
           from one to N that are not divisible by any of the factors [2, 3, 5].

     Let's take N=5 as an example:
        1 - not divisible by 2, 3, or 5
        2 - divisible by 2
        3 - divisible by 3
        4 - divisible by 2
        5 - divisible by 5
     Answer: 1 (only one number isn't divisible by any of 2, 3, 5) **/


    /** 3. Write a method called camelCaseMe()
           Given a string, this method converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. 

     * The first word should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized
     * The next words should always be capitalized.
     Examples
     "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
     "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
     "The_Stealth-Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior" **/
